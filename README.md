# Shortest Path Finder using Dijkstra's Algorithm

This project implements a **Shortest Path Finder** using **Dijkstra’s Algorithm** in Java. It models a real-world urban network and computes the shortest route between two locations, similar to GPS navigation systems.

## 📖 Project Overview

Urban navigation presents challenges like complex road networks and varying traffic conditions. This project uses **graph theory** and **Dijkstra’s algorithm** to compute optimal paths between locations in Bangalore’s city network. 

The implementation provides:
- A graph-based representation of locations and routes
- An interactive console interface for user input and result display
- Realistic distance modeling for validation

---

## 🚀 Features

- Find shortest paths between major Bangalore locations
- Displays total distance and the path taken
- Lists all distances from a selected starting point
- Validates user input to avoid errors
- Modular architecture for future enhancements

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Java**
- **Data Structures:** HashMap, PriorityQueue, Adjacency List
- Graph Theory concepts
- Algorithm design (Greedy method for shortest path)

├── Graph.java                 # Graph representation and Dijkstra’s implementation
├── Edge.java                  # Represents edges with destination and weight
├── Node.java                  # Helper class for PriorityQueue
└── BangaloreRouteFinder.java  # Main class with user interface
```

---

## 📌 How It Works

1. Users select a **starting location** and **destination** from a predefined list.
2. Dijkstra’s algorithm calculates the shortest route and total distance.
3. Results are displayed in an interactive console.

Example:
```
=== Bangalore Route Finder ===
Available locations:
1. Majestic
2. MG Road
3. Brigade Road
...

Enter starting location: Majestic
Enter destination: Jayanagar

✅ === SHORTEST ROUTE FOUND ===
From: Majestic → To: Jayanagar
Total Distance: 13 km
Route: Majestic → Banashankari → Jayanagar
```
